Pine is a static site generator. It uses [Branches][branches] at its core to
convert a directory of content to a static collection of HTML and CSS.
You can download the latest .phar executable [here][latest]. 

After that, you can add the executable to the `$PATH` and just use
`pine`. Finally, you can create a new site with:

```bash
pine new blog # Where blog is the name of your site
```


[branches]: /branches
[latest]: https://alberteddu.github.io/pine/downloads/pine-latest.phar
